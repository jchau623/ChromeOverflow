A Google Chrome extension for developers, by developers created during NWHacks 2017.

## Inspiration
As teaching assistants for undergraduate level software construction classes, we often see students 
report their errors or exceptions with little context of what the student has tried to resolve the issue. We thought of
a better way to resolve this issue - letting the student take the first step in helping theirselves by making a simple
query to Stack Overflow. A tool like ChromeOverflow can help programmers become more self sufficient in understanding 
and debugging common programming problems.

## How it works
ChromeOverflow provides a unified view of the top five Stack Overflow results for different exceptions you may 
encounter while using the Google Chrome browser.

*Have a JavaScript error?*

*Open ChromeOverflow and get some potential help from StackOverflow*

*Read it right in the console, or open up the question to see more answers!*

## Challenges
- Handling the listening of many different types of JavaScript errors
- Sending detected errors to the ChromeOverflow tab in the developer tools

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works*! 

## What we learned 
Teamwork makes the dream work.

## What's next for ChromeOverflow?
There are still many great opportunities for extending ChromeOverflow! For this project, we have numerous backlogged ideas:
- A "Show More" button that shows more Stack Overflow results when clicked
- Better user friendly UX when using the Chrome extension
- Expanding this project past Chrome, abstracting it for error/exception messages in all languages and platforms!
